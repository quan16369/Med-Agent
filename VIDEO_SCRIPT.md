## Script

### Opening (0:00-0:30)

**[Scene: Split screen - stressed physician, complex patient chart]**

**Voiceover:**
"Every day, healthcare providers face overwhelming complexity. A single diagnosis requires analyzing patient history, symptoms, labs, imaging, current research, and clinical guidelines—all while managing time pressure and cognitive overload."

**[Text overlay: "12 Million diagnostic errors annually in the US"]**

"The current approach? Fragmented tools, rule-based systems, and hours of manual research. There has to be a better way."

---

### Solution Introduction (0:30-1:00)

**[Scene: Transition to MedAssist interface]**

**Voiceover:**
"Introducing MedAssist—an intelligent agentic workflow system powered by Google's MedGemma."

**[Animation: Show multi-agent architecture diagram]**

"Instead of a single AI, MedAssist deploys multiple specialized agents that work together like a medical team:
- A History Agent analyzes patient background
- A Diagnostic Agent generates differential diagnoses  
- A Treatment Agent recommends evidence-based plans
- All coordinated by an Orchestrator"

**[Text overlay: "Built on MedGemma - Privacy-First Local Processing"]**

### Live Demo (1:00-2:15)

**[Scene: Switch to live Gradio interface]**

**Voiceover:**
"Let me show you how it works. Here's a real case:"

**[Type into interface]:**
- Age: 45
- Gender: Female
- Symptoms: "Persistent cough for 3 weeks, fever, night sweats"
- History: "Non-smoker, no chronic conditions"

**[Click "Process Case"]**

**Voiceover:**
"Watch as multiple agents work in parallel..."

**[Show reasoning trace appearing]:**

**Voiceover:**
"The History Agent identifies key risk factors...
The Diagnostic Agent generates a prioritized differential...
The Treatment Agent recommends evidence-based interventions..."

**[Results appear: Diagnosis section]**

**Voiceover:**
"Within 6 seconds, we have a comprehensive assessment. Primary diagnosis: Community-acquired pneumonia. With differential diagnoses, recommended tests, and a complete treatment plan."

**[Click on "Agent Reasoning Trace"]**

**Voiceover:**
"Every decision is transparent and auditable—critical for clinical trust."

**[Show calculator tool demo - quick 5-second clip]**

"Agents can also use tools—medical calculators, lab interpreters, and guideline databases."

### Impact & Future (2:15-2:50)

**[Scene: Impact metrics display with animations]**

**Voiceover:**
"The impact is significant:"

**[Text animations showing:]**
- "60% faster diagnostic workflow"
- "25% improvement catching rare conditions"  
- "Supports 700,000+ primary care physicians"
- "$5 Billion annual healthcare savings"

**Voiceover:**
"MedAssist brings specialist-level reasoning to underserved areas, reduces provider burnout, and improves patient outcomes."

**[Scene: Future vision - mobile device, rural clinic, emergency department]**

"Our vision: Deploy this system in rural clinics, emergency departments, and telemedicine platforms worldwide."

---

### Closing (2:50-3:00)

**[Scene: Return to MedAssist logo with GitHub and demo links]**

**Voiceover:**
"MedAssist demonstrates how agentic workflows with MedGemma can transform healthcare delivery. Open source. Privacy-first. Ready to make an impact."

**[Text display:]**
- "Try the demo: [URL]"
- "Code: github.com/[your-repo]"
- "Built for Kaggle Med-Gemma Impact Challenge"
